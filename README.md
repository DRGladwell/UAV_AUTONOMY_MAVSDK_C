# UAV_AUTONOMY_MAVSDK_C
Repository for to make a UAV autonomous. The UAV will be using a pixracer flight controler running px4 firmware. The code will be running on a raspberry pi2 which acts as a companion computer for the UAV. The companion computer computers the autonmous behavior and the flight controller handles the flight control of these autonomously decided goals. It's worth noting that an overall mission plan is provided before had by a different code block. This plan used the same communication protocol as the rest of the project which is MAVlink or more precisely the C++ version of MAVSDK. The SDK simplifies the transmition of MAVLink messages so the companion computer can receieve and send data to the flight controler and eventually to the ground station.
